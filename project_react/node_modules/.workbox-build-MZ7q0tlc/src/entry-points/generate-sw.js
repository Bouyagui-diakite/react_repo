/**
 * This method creates a list of URLs to precache, referred to as a "precache
 * manifest", based on the options you provide.
 *
 * It also takes in additional options that configures the service worker's
 * behavior, like any `runtimeCaching` rules it should use.
 *
 * Based on the precache manifest and the additional configuration, it writes
 * a ready-to-use service worker file to disk at `swDest`.
